- Installed TightVNC server on Raspberry PI!</br> This could be nice when we need the GUI (and don't  have access to a screen, 99% of the time @ school...) Start it with tightvncserver.
- Searched some WEP cracking scripts for inspiration ([LINK](http://www.itsecurenet.com/crack-wifi-wep-password-script-backtrack/)

Make script executable = chmod +x yolo.sh
