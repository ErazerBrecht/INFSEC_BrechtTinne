- Installed TightVNC server on Raspberry PI!</br> This could be nice when we need the GUI (and don't have access to a screen, 99% of the time @ school...) Start it with tightvncserver. Password is ciscocisco
- Searched some WEP cracking scripts for inspiration ([LINK](http://www.itsecurenet.com/crack-wifi-wep-password-script-backtrack/))

###How to / Things learnt:

- Make script executable = chmod +x yolo.sh
- if needs to end with fi in bash script
- Bash script debugging sucks like hell
- $1, first argument after script name => yolo.sh wlan1 => $1 == wlan1
